# Restore/Import Account

Any time you want to restore or import your account , just click on the wallet icon on the top right of the asset list page. In the popup panel, hit the "Import Account" button.\

&#x20;If you open the "Advanced" option, you will find that Clover wallet supports two Keypair Types, SR25519 and ED25519 for substrate networks. Clover wallet uses SR25519 by default. If you import a group of seed phrases a second time, it will be accepted as the other Keypair type. For the third time, it will not be passed.

So anytime you find the imported account address unexpected, try to change the keypair type and import again.&#x20;
