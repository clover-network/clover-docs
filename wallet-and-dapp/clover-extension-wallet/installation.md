# Getting Started

## Installation

You can install Clover Wallet from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clover-wallet/nhnkbkgjikgcigadomkphalanndcapjk).

## Create New Wallet

To start, you need to create a new multi-chain wallet or restore a wallet if you have one. Note that Clover wallet only supports seed word restore.\

While creating, please do write down your seed phrase to a safe place that no one knows.
