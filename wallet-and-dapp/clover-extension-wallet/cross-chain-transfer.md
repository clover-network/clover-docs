If you have the knowledge of the three different CLV assets. It is time to make a cross-chain transfer. Let us give an example of **how to transfer native CLV token to Ethereum**. Here we will use extension wallet to explain (You can use mobile wallet to do cross-chain transfer as well !).

### 1. Click action button and select 'Cross Chain'

Please noted that:&#x20;

* If you cross-chain transfer CLV to Ethereum or BSC, there will be a cross-chain fee + transaction fee charged.  However, users don't need to pay ETH or BNB as cross-chain fee.
* You can check current cross-chain fee at [https://tx.clover.finance/](https://tx.clover.finance)

### 4. Confirm your cross-chain transaction

Once you confirm and send the cross-chain transaction, you can just wait for your transaction to be successful. You can check your cross-chain transaction in your wallet or Clover's cross-chain transaction explorer at [https://tx.clover.finance/](https://tx.clover.finance)
