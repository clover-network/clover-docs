## What is Clover Web Wallet

Clover web wallet is the most secure decentralized web-based digital wallet. It has a lot of great features:

### 1. OAuth social logins without password

Usually, a crypto wallet needs users to provide a seed phrase or a private key to secure their crypto assets. This may lead to two risks: 

* Users may forget their seed phrase or private key, and they will never get back of their assets.
* Users may have their seed phrase or private key hacked, and they will permanently lose their assets.

Clover web wallet provides a OAuth social login mechanism, no passwords and no downloads.  Users can connect their wallet account by Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

### 2. Non-custodial Key Management

Clover web wallet never stores users' private key or seed phrase in cloud service.  All the credential info are accessible only by users.

### 3. Send and receive digital currencies via email

### 4. Muti-chain support
