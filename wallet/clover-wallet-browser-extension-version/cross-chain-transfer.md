# Cross-chain transfer

Cross-chain transfer through the Clover wallet is as easy as sending tokens. Just click on the "Cross Chain" button and then transfer to the address on the other block chain networks. The pair CLV and CLV on BSC is supported by default. More and more pairs are coming soon.

Note that the cross-chain fee is 1 CLV for now. This number can be changed through community governance in the future.
