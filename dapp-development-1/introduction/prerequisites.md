# Prerequisites

Developing a DApp requires you familiar with several tools. We'll use some tools in this tutorial but we assume you have at least basic knowledge with them.&#x20;

### :tools: [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.7.5/)

{% hint style="info" %}
Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behavior of accounts within the Clover state.
{% endhint %}

&#x20;We'll use to solidity as the programming language to write on-chain logic.&#x20;

### :pineapple: [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction)

{% hint style="info" %}
JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
{% endhint %}

We'll implement the frontend UI logic using javascript.&#x20;

### :watermelon: [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org)

{% hint style="info" %}
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.&#x20;
