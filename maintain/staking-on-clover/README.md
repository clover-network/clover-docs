# Staking on Clover

Clover Ivy network uses NPOS(Nominated Proof-of-Stake) as its consensus mechanism which is the same as [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network) uses. CLV users can participate the consensus as norminators. Norminators may support validator candiates by collatoring their CLV tokens and receive staking rewards.

This tutorial focuses on how to staking on Clover Ivy netowrk. The detailed information of how staking works could be found at the [Polkadot Staking wiki pages.](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking)
