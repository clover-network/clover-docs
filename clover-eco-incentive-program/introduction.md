# Introduction

The Developer Incentive Program (DIP) is a Clover-native consensus feature that aims to direct a percentage of transaction fees to registered smart contracts to incentivize in Clover third party contract developers and commons, mainly to boost external dApp development which ultimately enlarges the Clover DeFi ecosystem overall.

The User Incentive Program(UIP) is another Clover consensus feature aims to Lower the barrier for users to use the Clover network for transactions. Since Clover enable the dapp functions of Ethereum chain, there is a fundamental setup to bind Clover address and virtual Ethereum Address. Then the incentive program will work consistently on both networks.
